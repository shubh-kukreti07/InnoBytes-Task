<h2>Insights</h2>

1.Sales Trends & Overview:

Analyze sales over time to detect peak seasons or periods of higher sales. This could reveal important trends such as increased demand during specific months or events (e.g., festive seasons). Identify consistent underperforming periods to explore reasons such as low inventory, marketing gaps, or external market conditions.

2.Product Category Preferences:

Analyze the distribution of product categories and sizes to identify the most popular items. For instance, if certain sizes or product categories (like T-shirts or Shirts) are more frequently purchased, this suggests product preference trends. Identify products with high return or cancellation rates to explore potential quality issues or mismatch between customer expectations and product descriptions.

3.Fulfillment Efficiency:

Compare the effectiveness of different fulfillment methods (e.g., Merchant vs. Amazon) by analyzing order delivery times and cancellation rates. Investigate whether certain fulfillment methods are associated with higher customer satisfaction or lower shipping times, indicating better logistics performance.

4.Geographical Sales Distribution:

Explore the geographical sales distribution across cities and states. Identify regions with the highest sales and investigate factors contributing to this success, such as local promotions, population density, or logistics networks. Highlight underperforming regions that could benefit from better marketing, logistical improvements, or targeted campaigns.
